		<h1>Material Constants</h1>

		<p class="desc">
		These constants define properties common to all material types,
		with the exception of Texture Combine Operations which only apply to [page:MeshBasicMaterial.combine MeshBasicMaterial], [page:MeshLambertMaterial.combine MeshLambertMaterial] and [page:MeshPhongMaterial.combine MeshPhongMaterial].<br />
		</p>


		<h2>Side</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.FrontSide
		THREE.BackSide
		THREE.DoubleSide
		</code>
		<p>
		Defines which side of faces will be rendered - front, back or both.
		Default is [page:Constant FrontSide].
		</p>


		<h2>Colors</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.NoColors
		THREE.FaceColors
		THREE.VertexColors
		</code>
		<p>
		[page:Constant NoColors] is the default and applies the material's color to all faces.<br />
		[page:Constant FaceColors] colors faces according to each [page:Face3 Face3] [page:Color Color] value.<br />
		[page:Constant VertexColors] colors faces according to each [page:Face3 Face3] vertexColors value. This is an array of three [page:Color Color]s, one for each vertex in the face.<br />
		See the [example:webgl_geometry_colors geometry / colors] example.
		</p>

		<h2>Blending Mode</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.NoBlending
		THREE.NormalBlending
		THREE.AdditiveBlending
		THREE.SubtractiveBlending
		THREE.MultiplyBlending
		THREE.CustomBlending
		</code>


		<p>
		These control the source and destination blending equations for the material's RGB and Alpha sent to the WebGLRenderer for use by WebGL.<br />
		[page:Constant NormalBlending] is the default.<br />
		Note that [page:Constant CustomBlending] must be set to use [page:CustomBlendingEquation Custom Blending Equations].<br />
		See the [example:webgl_materials_blending materials / blending] example.<br />
		</p>

		<h2>Depth Mode</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.NeverDepth
		THREE.AlwaysDepth
		THREE.LessDepth
		THREE.LessEqualDepth
		THREE.GreaterEqualDepth
		THREE.GreaterDepth
		THREE.NotEqualDepth
		</code>
		<p>
		Which depth function the material uses to compare incoming pixels Z-depth against the current Z-depth buffer value. If the result of the comparison is true, the pixel will be drawn.<br />
		[page:Materials NeverDepth] will never return true.<br />
		[page:Materials AlwaysDepth] will always return true.<br />
		[page:Materials LessDepth] will return true if the incoming pixel Z-depth is less than the current buffer Z-depth.<br />
		[page:Materials LessEqualDepth] is the default and will return true if the incoming pixel Z-depth is less than or equal to the current buffer Z-depth.<br />
		[page:Materials GreaterEqualDepth] will return true if the incoming pixel Z-depth is greater than or equal to the current buffer Z-depth.<br />
		[page:Materials GreaterDepth] will return true if the incoming pixel Z-depth is greater than the current buffer Z-depth.<br />
		[page:Materials NotEqualDepth] will return true if the incoming pixel Z-depth is not equal to the current buffer Z-depth.<br />
		</p>

		<h2>Texture Combine Operations</h2>
		<code>
		THREE.MultiplyOperation
		THREE.MixOperation
		THREE.AddOperation
		</code>
		<p>
		These define how the result of the surface's color is combined with the environment map (if present), for [page:MeshBasicMaterial.combine MeshBasicMaterial], [page:MeshLambertMaterial.combine MeshLambertMaterial] and [page:MeshPhongMaterial.combine MeshPhongMaterial]. <br />
		[page:Constant MultiplyOperation] is the default and multiplies the environment map color with the surface color.<br />
		[page:Constant MixOperation] uses reflectivity to blend between the two colors.<br />
		[page:Constant AddOperation] adds the two colors.
		</p>
