		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<p class="desc">
			This is used internally by [page:PointLight PointLights] for calculating shadows, and also serves as
			a base class for the other shadow classes.
		</p>


		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>
			<code>
//Create a WebGLRenderer and turn on shadows in the renderer
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap; // default THREE.PCFShadowMap

//Create a PointLight and turn on shadows for the light
var light = new THREE.PointLight( 0xffffff, 1, 100 );
light.position.set( 0, 10, 0 );
light.castShadow = true;            // default false
scene.add( light );

//Set up shadow properties for the light
light.shadow.mapSize.width = 512;  // default
light.shadow.mapSize.height = 512; // default
light.shadow.camera.near = 0.5;       // default
light.shadow.camera.far = 500      // default

//Create a sphere that cast shadows (but does not receive them)
var sphereGeometry = new THREE.SphereBufferGeometry( 5, 32, 32 );
var sphereMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( { color: 0xff0000 } );
var sphere = new THREE.Mesh( sphereGeometry, sphereMaterial );
sphere.castShadow = true; //default is false
sphere.receiveShadow = false; //default
scene.add( sphere );

//Create a plane that receives shadows (but does not cast them)
var planeGeometry = new THREE.PlaneBufferGeometry( 20, 20, 32, 32 );
var planeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } )
var plane = new THREE.Mesh( planeGeometry, planeMaterial );
plane.receiveShadow = true;
scene.add( plane );

//Create a helper for the shadow camera (optional)
var helper = new THREE.CameraHelper( light.shadow.camera );
scene.add( helper );
			</code>
		</p>

		<h2>Constructor</h2>

		<h3>[name]( [param:Camera camera] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Camera camera] - the light's view of the world.<br /><br />

		Create a new [name]. This is not intended to be called directly - it is called
		internally by [page:PointLight] or used as a base class by other light shadows.
		</p>

		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>[property:Camera camera]</h3>
		<p>
			The light's view of the world. This is used to generate a depth map of the scene; objects behind
			other objects from the light's perspective will be in shadow.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float bias]</h3>
		<p>
			Shadow map bias, how much to add or subtract from the normalized depth when deciding whether a surface is in shadow.<br />
			The default is 0. Very tiny adjustments here (in the order of 0.0001) may help reduce artefacts in shadows
		</p>

		<h3>[property:WebGLRenderTarget map]</h3>
		<p>
			The depth map generated using the internal camera; a location beyond a pixel's depth is
			in shadow. Computed internally during rendering.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Vector2 mapSize]</h3>
		<p>
			A [Page:Vector2] defining the width and height of the shadow map.<br /><br />

			Higher values give better quality shadows at the cost of computation time. Values must be
			powers of 2, up to the [page:WebGLRenderer.capabilities].maxTextureSize for a given device,
			although the width and height don't have to be the same (so, for example, (512, 1024) is valid).
			The default is *( 512, 512 )*.
		</p>


		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrix]</h3>
		<p>
			Model to shadow camera space, to compute location and depth in shadow map. Stored
			in a [page:Matrix4 Matrix4]. This is computed internally during rendering.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Float radius]</h3>
		<p>
			Setting this to values greater than 1 will blur the edges of the shadow.<br />

			High values will cause unwanted banding effects in the shadows - a greater [page:.mapSize mapSize]
			will allow for a higher value to be used here before these effects become visible.<br /><br />

			Note that this has no effect if the [page:WebGLRenderer.shadowMap.type] is set to [page:Renderer BasicShadowMap].
		</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<h3>[method:LightShadow copy]( [param:LightShadow source] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copies value of all the properties from the [page:LightShadow source] to this
		SpotLight.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:LightShadow clone]()</h3>
		<p>
		Creates a new LightShadow with the same properties as this one.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Object toJSON]()</h3>
		<p>
		Serialize this LightShadow.
		</p>
